## Hi!

My name is Derren. I am a freelance sound designer/audio engineer based in Singapore. 

I have been passionate about audio engineering since I was a teenager. It started out with a love for music, which led me to wanting to learn more about the technical aspects of music production. This eventually led to me experimenting with sound effects, thus kickstarting my journey into audio post production. 

I decided to take up a WSQ Diploma in Content Post Production (Sound Engineering) in June 2021 with [Singapore Media Academy](https://www.mediaacademy.sg/), where I was awarded the "Best Student Award" for the cohort.
