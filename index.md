## Hi!

My name is Derren. I am a freelance sound designer/audio engineer based in Singapore. 

I have been passionate about audio engineering since I was a teenager. It started out with a love for music, which led me to wanting to learn more about the technical aspects of music production. This eventually led to me experimenting with sound effects, thus kickstarting my journey into audio post production. 

This site is still under construction.
